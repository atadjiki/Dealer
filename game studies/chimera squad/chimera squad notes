Chimera Squad Notes:

- choose squad screen - select characters and show their attributes/skills/bio
- game freezes for conversation events where the player can only skip it 
- conversations are done by simply putting an overlay on the camera

the default page is my favorite from this game. from one screen you can basically access and control everything relevant. 

- its really just management UI over a 3d model and characters to make it more juicy
- clicking different action menu items takes you to different parts of the XCOM base
- you can see characters in your roster huddled around in every room you go
- maybe we dont need A star after all,  just pose the character models around when you load  aroom

here are the items on the screen:

Objectives: (right upper corner)
- objective title ("investigate sacred coil")
- task list (check boxes to indicate completion)
- we can use this system for tracking our weekly and daily tasks

- pause button and help button in left bottom corner

resource bar/tracker - upper right corner (top)

here there is a meter for city anarchy, as well as the counters for the player resources( elerium, intel, credits)
we can replace this with our counters for money, drugs, ingredients, etc

under this bar is a list of all available actions

City Map - moves to the map room (which is the default room)

Assembly - missions that yield tech upgrades 

Spec Ops - special missions that yield resources

Training - special missions that yield character upgrades

------

then we have a list of info actions

Armory - available weapons

Supply - marketplace 

Investigation - a quest tracker 

---

we then have list items for notifications

(i.e "assembly idle", etc)

notice how the game puts all these different types of items in the same list on the right hand side. 

the middle of the screen is uncluttered so that the player can see the background and stuff going on

on the bottom right corner is a display of the current day and time

---

action items:
- the action items in the panel have very clear visuals. they are each a different color, have a unique symbol. 
- action items also have a square box which contains the portrait of any character assigned to them. 
- the player can easily tell if a character is assigned to a task or not. 
- if they want more info or context they can open the items up, but get a lot of info at a glance


- when an info or action item is clicked, the camera moves to a different part of the base and more detailed UI comes up pertaining
to that item

- for example, if you click "Training" you are taken to the training UI where you can select a unit and assign them a training task 


the city map is the most important of all these menu items because it is the only one that allows you to actually advance the game
it is from here that the player initiates missions and the game will move out of the management mode to xcom fighting mode
of course in our game we dont have that fighting mode, so the missions will be auto resolved


*honorable mention - TOOL TIPS - the ammount of tooltips in the game is awesome. every button or text has a tooltip 


the map view has a TON of stuff on it:

in the map view, you still can see the objectives, time, resources
you also see the city map with all its different districts
each district has a name, info, etc
each district also a possible mission attached to it
the mission cards present you with a reward, severity, etc
