Dealer is a point and click game in which the player must buy and sell drugs to make a profit

For now, the game takes place in a nightclub. Every "day" begins with the dealer's plug giving him drugs 
and placing a quota for the week. The player must make enough money to satisfy the quota or the plug will cut them off, ending the game. 
Each night, the player has 8 hours to interact with people inside the nightclub. They must be careful however, as to not get caught or in trouble
There will be a cast of regulars who will be there every night, and will be faithful customers if the player treats them well
Besides paying back the plug, the player can buy upgrades like increasing their inventory size and protection. 
There may also be rival dealers who the player will have to compete with.
